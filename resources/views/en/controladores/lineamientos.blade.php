                                   	<li>Aerodrom control service: Provided to the aerodrome traffic. The air traffic control position that provides it is the TWR (Control Tower) in the ATZ / CTR.</li>
                                    <li>Approach control service: Provided to the departure and arrival controlled traffic. It is provided by APP (Approach Control Office) in the vecinity of the airport.</li>
                                    <li>Area control service: Provided to the controlled traffic in control areas. It is provided by ACC (Area Control Center) in CTAs, TMAs and AWYs.</li>

                                   It means that Rosario Tower (SAAR_TWR) does the job for control tower and approach control as it controls the whole CTR and TMA. Hence, it does the job of Center when aircrafts cross the TMA flying en route.</p>

The decision made by the controller who receives the aircraft will always prevale. For example: a flight arriving to the airport of C&oacute;rdoba (SACO) must be transferred by C&oacute;rdoba Control (SACO_APP) to C&oacute;rdoba Tower (SACO_TWR) at some point inside the limits of the controlled airspace by C&oacute;rdoba Tower, that means C&oacute;rdoba CTR or even some miles earlier.</p>
                                   
                                   <p align="justify">SACO_TWR will request to SACO_APP on the coordination where and with what flight parameters (flight level and speed) should be transferred. Given the case that the upper control requests information about charts in use, the controller will have to tell the pilot to cotnact the other position for more information. Given the opposite case, that an aircraft departs, the coordination must done before the takeoff providing restrictions of climb or requests of crossing a point above or below a certain flight level.</p>

Therefore, with the aim of simulating the reality, the positions that provide radar control service will be then defined. These ones are able to give vectors always above the MRVA of each sector, expressed <a href="http://ais.anac.gov.ar/descarga/aip-5209704d8fffd" target="ext" class="text-info">here</a> and there is no necessity of asking the pilot to report constantly its position, as it is on the radar screen.</p>

<p align="justify">The rest of the positions provide control by procedures, that is to say, thay cannot give vectors, only radioelectrical or magnetical references and thay must ask the pilot to report the position and flight parameters.</p>

<p  align="justify">Radar control positions are the following:</p>

	   <p align="justify">Note 1: Ezeiza North and Ezeiza South provide radar servicee within 100 NM from EZE VOR from FL95 upwards and from FL145, from mile 100 until mile 150. Outside this airspace, radar service will continue to be provided in the whole FIR from FL195. </p>

									<p align="justify">On the other hand, AS2 will be required for control towers (_TWR) that comprise only a CTR.

Please see the table below.</p>
 

 

An air traffic permission is the clearance that the controller provides to a pilot for the flight to develop inside a defined airspace according to the flightplan (FPL).</p>

									<p align="justify">Ground control (GND) has got jurisdiction on aircrafts on ground on movement or not except for the runway, where the aerodrome control tower (TWR) has got exclusive jurisdiction.

									<p align="justify">Ground will regulate ground maneouvres, such as taxi from runway to apron, apron to runway or within the apron. Whenever there is a necessity of crossing the runway, the aircraft will have to wait at the holding point until the crossing is coordinated between Ground and Tower. This facility will also provide startup and pushback approvals as well as ground vehicles movements.</p>

									<p align="justify">Not all the airports count with a ground control service as well as not all airports count with a delivery service (DEL). In this case, GND will assume DEL service.</p>

									<p align="justify">At first contact, we must check that the pilot confirms ATIS info. This way, we know thay have the weather report, runway in use, etc. If they do not have it, we must provide it.</p>

									<p align="justify">Afterwards, the flightplan clearance will be required (as explained in Delivery / DEL) and, then, the startup and the pushback. At that moment, the turn will be provided (1, 2, 3...) depending on other aircrafts on the maneouvres area, indicating the runway in use and the QNH.</p>

									<p align="justify">When finished, taxi will be instructed via the necessary taxiways until the holding point of the runway in use. In case the aircraft must taxi behind another one, the corresponding traffic information will be given. Please find an example below:</p>
									
									<p align="justify"><em>LVARG, taxi behind the B738 of Argentina Airlines to holding point runway 13 via A and 5.</em></p>
									
									<p align="justify">As you can see, the type of aircraft must be provided.</p>

									<p align="justify">In case of convergent or front approaching traffic on ground, the ATC will decide the priority.</p>

									<p align="justify">Once the aircraft is at the holding point, it will be handed over to the TWR facility by right-clicking on the airacraft and selecting TRANSFER to choose the adjacent facility. The pilot will have to be told to contact the next facility, as per below:</p>
									
									<p align="justify"><em>LVARG contact Aeroparque Tower on 118.85, good day.</em></p>

									<p align="justify">Similarly, an arrival traffic, once the runway has been vacated, must be transferred to GND.</p>


									<p align="justify">To get access to all these interactions, the option ASSUME must be selected from the menu that shows up by right-clicking on the aircraft.</p>

									<p align="justify">The aircraft that vacates the runway in use will be instructed to taxi to the apron and once there, the aircraft will be cleared to change frequency, as per the below:</p>

									<p  align="justify">It is fully mandatory knowing the controlled airspace, whether the CTR or the TMA, runways, charts and  approaches in use, standard arrivals and departures, lower and upper airways that cross our airspace, as well as vertical and horizontal limits.</p>

									<p  align="justify">Take-off and landing clearances must be provided with the wind information (direction and speed). A rounded direction must be provided. This means that wind 356/13 must be reported as 360&deg; at 13 knots. When the speed is less than 5 knots, the runway with the best approach conditions, as navaids or light indications, could be chosen. Similarly, all descend clearances below the transition level must be provided with the QNH.</p>

									<p  align="justify">Likely, the Tower is responsible for determining tthe transition level (see Library).</p>

									<p  align="justify">Departures must always be coordinated with APP. In the case of APP absence, that is to say TWR/APP must report directly to Center the exit point of the TMA, as well as the time of arrival and the flight level at that point.</p>

									<p  align="justify">The center controller has got as jurisdiction all the airways (AWYs) inside a FIR. This means that it does not control any aircraft inside the FIR, but any aircraft on any AWY inside the FIR. For that condition to take place, the aircraft must be between the horizontal and vertical limits of the AWY.</p>

									<p  align="justify">Enroute aircrafts shall maintain a separation of 15nm and 1000ft between the minimum level of the airway and FL290, and 1000ft between FL290 and FL410 (depending on the aircraft RVSM / Reduced Vertical Separation Minima certification)</p>

									<p  align="justify">Regarding transfers, we must remember that most of the TMAs are controlled by TWR, except the cases when CTR and TMA are controlled by TWR and APP respectively. That is to say, transfers between CTR and TWR are totally usual in many argentinian airports. Transfers shall be preformed in coordination with the adjacent coordinator. This means that we are going to give descend clearances as coordinated, for example:</p>

									<p  align="justify"><em>LV-ARG call ready to descend, expect FL110 over ASADA</em></p>

									<p  align="justify">Similarly, it must be done with climbings.</p>

									<p  align="justify">We must take into consideration that most TMAs have as vertical limit FL245, other ones have lower limits like FL195 or FL075. This means that, if an aircraft flying on an airway at FL180 entries into a TMA with vertical limit FL245, CTR must hand the aircraft over to TWR or APP, while the aircraft flies inside that TMA. If the vertical limit would hve been FL075, the aircraft would have remained on CTR frequency.</p>

									<p  align="justify">Transfers between different CTRs shall be performed 15nm before the sector exit point.</p>

									<p  align="justify">In order to provide separation, speed adjustments or radar vectors will be instructed. We can appreciate more separation techniques on the Basic ATC Manual in the Library on this website.</p>

This airspace is defined by a circle of 100nm with the VOR EZE as a center between FL095 and FL450, and 150 nm with VOR EZE as a between FL145 and FL450. Outside this airspace, radar service is not provided and position report and ETA shall be requested to aircrafts. Reports shall be provided as follows:</p>

									<ul>
										<li>Callsign</li>
										<li>Position</li>
										<li>UTC Time</li>
										<li>Altitude or Flight Level</li>
										<li>Next point and ETA</li>
										<li>Next point from the previous one</li>
									</ul>

									<p  align="justify">For example:</p>

									<p  align="justify"><em>Ezeiza Center, LV-ARG position EGOKO at 12:35 flight level 220. We estimate EDRON at 12:53. Next point is NEU.</em></p>

									<p  align="justify">And the answer from Ezeiza Center:</p>

									<p  align="justify"><em>Roger LV-ARG, I expect you at 12:53 over EDRON</em></p>

									<p  align="justify">Whenever the ETA to the next point is later than 30 mins, the Center facility should request &quot;normal flight&quot; report each 30 minutes. Let's suppose that we cross EGOKO at 12:35 and we are going to cross EDRON at 13:15. We are going to report normal flight at 13:05 and EDRON at 13:15.</p>

									<p  align="justify">We must take consideration that the ATIS of a CTR position shall never contain runways in use, transition altitude or level nor any specific airport information. Only the position name in English. (EZEIZA CENTER, MENDOZA CENTER, etc.) If necessary, useful information can be included on the section &quot;Remarks&quot; as in the case of SAEF:</p>

									<p  align="justify"><em>Radar services is provided within 100 and 150 nm sorrounding SAEZ over FL095 and FL145 respectively / Servicio radar provisto dentro de las 100 y 150 nm con centro en SAEZ a partide FL095 y FL145 respectivamente.</em></p>

                                   <p  align="justify">When an aircraft decalres emergency, there are several things that we must do for it to develop normally on its duration.</p>

									<p  align="justify">The controller must obtain relevant information about what happened to the aircraft, what failure occurred, how many souls are onboard, its autonomy, if it is going to reach the runway and, lastly, if it requires emergency services.<br />
									Once the controller gets to know all the data, the emergency will be able to be managed more effectively.</p>

									<p  align="justify">The controller must remember that if other facilities are active, the emergency must be announced and coordinated with the rest of the facilities in order to inform the rest of the aircrafts, as well as the rest of the aircrafts on frequency must be informed.</p>

									<p  align="justify">The controller must clarify to all the aircrafts that there is an emergency and, therefore, the airport is currently closed until the end of the emergency. What does this mean? That no aircrafts will be able to land or take off until the aircraft on emergency declares its end.This does not mean that the flights airborne must flight to the alternate airport, but the controller must be able to tell them what to to do in order not to interfere with the aircraft on emergency. Please find an example below:</p>

									<p  align="justify">An aircraft is arriving to Mar del Plata and declares emergency due to the loss of an engine. The controller must be clear that the aircraft has the priority and, therefore, if there are other aircrafts on the way, the controller must organize them in order to give priority to the one on emergency. In the case of VFR flights flying in the zone, the controller should make them orbit at some point in order to keep the control zone clear of traffic. Aircrafts on ground shall be able to maneouvre without any problem.</p>

									<p  align="justify">During an emergency, the controller must communicate only with the affected aircraft, shall dispatch aircrafts already airborne and shall tell them what to do in order to keep the area clear of traffic. However, the controller shall not approve any flightplan under any circumstances. The frequency shall be kept in silence and all landing or take-off requests shall be ignored.</p>

									<p  align="justify">The controller shall provide to the emergency weather information such as wind, visibility, ceiling and QNH. A quicker way to the runway may be suggested to the aircraft.</p>
